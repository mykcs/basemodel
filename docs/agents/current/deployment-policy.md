# Deployment and validation policy

Last reviewed: **2026-08-12**

## Authority

```text
GitHub = canonical source
non-main branches / PRs = Vercel Preview
main = Vercel Production
Production identity = https://basemodel-preview.vercel.app
```

**Vercel is the only ordinary deployment authority.** Historical provider files, snapshots or fallback scripts are not normal Preview, release, Production verification, quota-reporting or completion-report surfaces.

GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages remain retired.

## Vercel responsibilities

Project `basemodel-preview` owns both deployment environments. Every deployable Preview/Production build uses:

`npm run verify:deploy && npm run build`

Do not disable Vercel Git deployment on `main`.

Preview acceptance requires exact-head provider success plus real route/metadata inspection. Preview is automatically `noindex` when `VERCEL_ENV=preview`; canonical/hreflang continue to point to the stable Production project domain.

## Vercel build-budget discipline

Vercel deployments/builds are finite resources. Optimize the **number of provider-triggering ref updates**, not only the runtime of each build.

Default target for a coherent feature:

```text
one coherent branch/PR
-> one atomic multi-file push
-> one initial exact-head Preview
-> at most one corrective Preview after real route/log inspection
-> one Production build per accepted release batch
```

Rules:

1. Finish the coherent code/content batch and run the strongest available local/Agent checks before the first push. Do not push every typo, intermediate experiment or file write.
2. Reuse the existing branch/PR. Do not create a duplicate PR to repair the same deployment or migration unless the old branch is genuinely unsafe to continue.
3. When a GitHub connector would otherwise write files one by one, prefer a checked-out worktree or one Git data API multi-file commit (`blob -> tree -> commit -> ref`). Sequential Contents API writes can create one Vercel deployment per ref update.
4. Keep stacked PRs only for real, reviewable dependencies. Stabilize the parent before repeatedly pushing the child, and do not mirror the same fix across multiple branches.
5. When several already-accepted PRs belong to one release window, one explicit integration/release head plus one merge to `main` may be used if authorship, review, rollback and ownership remain clear. Do not combine unrelated or unaccepted work only to reduce build count.
6. Batch evidence-driven Preview fixes. The normal budget is one initial Preview plus at most one corrective Preview; more pushes require a concrete reason such as a newly discovered Gate failure, exact-head synchronization conflict or real browser finding.
7. Avoid direct micro-commits to `main`. Every deploy-relevant `main` update can become a Production build.
8. Docs/Agent-only changes should remain outside deploy-relevant paths so the ignored-build step can skip them. Do not touch `src/`, `public/`, `scripts/`, tests or deployment config merely to obtain a Preview badge.
9. Vercel same-branch auto-cancellation limits wasted execution when a newer push supersedes a running job, but a canceled/ignored deployment is not a substitute for batching pushes.
10. When usage matters, report deployment triggers separately as `READY`, `ERROR`, `CANCELED` and ignored/skipped when provider evidence is available. Do not report only successful builds.

## Parallel Agent and stacked-PR integration

The reusable cross-project protocol is owned by `mykcs/myk-skills/website-improve/references/parallel-agent-delivery.md`. This repository adapts it as follows:

```text
latest intended base
├─ focused worker branch / Draft PR A ┐
├─ focused worker branch / Draft PR B ├─> explicit integration/release head
└─ focused worker branch / Draft PR C ┘        -> one exact-head combined Preview
                                               -> one accepted merge to main
                                               -> one Vercel Production build
```

- Worker conversations do not merge their PRs to `main` independently when the owner intends one release batch. They record base/head SHA, changed files, checks, dependencies and shared surfaces such as layouts, global CSS, theme tokens, navigation, dependency manifests, lockfiles and deployment configuration.
- The integration conversation refreshes current `main`, inspects every candidate diff/check, and classifies textual, semantic/UI, dependency/generated and provider/release conflicts. A clean Git merge is not combined-product acceptance.
- For stacked PRs, preserve the real dependency chain while it is still under review. Once the selected changes are accepted for one release, create one explicit integration head from the current intended base rather than merging each stacked layer separately into `main`.
- Run `npm run verify:deploy` and `npm run build` on the exact integrated head. When hosted review is necessary, use one combined Vercel Preview and inspect the affected real routes, desktop/mobile behavior and light/dark themes before release.
- Earlier worker-branch Previews that already ran remain consumed. Opening a new integration chat or PR cannot retroactively turn them into one build; only future ref updates and current Vercel trigger rules can be controlled.
- After the integration PR is accepted, merge/update `main` once. Mark worker PRs as merged, superseded or still pending with explicit links instead of leaving ambiguous duplicate release paths.
- Do not batch unrelated or unaccepted work merely to save builds. Reviewability, attribution, rollback and research/product integrity remain hard requirements.

## Executable build-scope protection

`vercel.json` owns two safeguards:

- `github.autoJobCancelation: true` keeps the newest same-branch job authoritative;
- `ignoreCommand: node scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs` decides whether a build is needed.

The ignore script compares `VERCEL_GIT_PREVIOUS_SHA` with the current commit so multi-commit pushes and accumulated docs-only changes are classified against the previous successful deployment, rather than only looking at `HEAD^..HEAD`. It skips only when no deploy-relevant path changed. Missing Git history, an invalid range, or any uncertainty **fails open** and runs the build.

The path classifier and policy are protected by `src/lib/vercelBuildBudget.test.ts`.

## Production release

After the accepted exact head is current with `main`:

```text
merge to main
-> Vercel Production build
-> https://basemodel-preview.vercel.app
-> verify indexability, canonical/hreflang, robots/sitemap, representative routes and interaction
```

One accepted release batch should normally create one Production build. Do not add a second `main` micro-commit merely to adjust release notes or wording that could have been included before merge.

## Repository Gate

Executable truth lives in `package.json`. `npm run verify:deploy` remains provider-neutral and includes the project’s deterministic checks/tests/audits. Do not weaken a valid Gate to get a green deployment.

Full browser suites and third-party/network audits remain on demand when the changed surface requires them.

## Vercel-first completion report

Ordinary completion reports are Vercel-first and report separately:

```text
Repository Gate/build
Vercel deployment triggers: total / READY / ERROR / CANCELED / ignored when known
Vercel Preview + exact head
Preview route/metadata acceptance
Merged to main
Vercel Production deployment + public verification
External boundary, only when it materially blocked or changed the result
```

For a parallel release batch, also report candidate PRs inspected, accepted/deferred/superseded, conflict classes checked, integration head SHA, combined Preview evidence and final worker-PR disposition.

Do not include Cloudflare in an ordinary completion report merely because historical config, an old snapshot or dormant fallback code still exists. Mention a legacy provider only when:

- the user explicitly asks about it;
- the task changes or retires that legacy surface;
- rollback is actually being exercised; or
- live provider evidence shows unexpected legacy activity.

## Legacy external-integration safeguard

A historical external Git integration may still exist outside repository control. Until it is disabled account-side, an existing skip prefix may remain necessary as a silent compatibility safeguard. It is not an ordinary deployment stage, quota to monitor, or completion-report line unless it unexpectedly activates or the task explicitly concerns its retirement.

Do not infer exact provider quota counters without authoritative account evidence.
